# Classify medical diagnosis with ICD-10 code

This application was built to demonstrate IBM's Watson Natural Language Classifier (NLC). The data set we will be using, [ICD-10-GT-AA.csv](data/ICD-10-GT-AA.csv), contains a subset of [ICD-10](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICD-10) entries. ICD-10 is the 10th revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems. In short, it is a medical classification list by the World Health Organization (WHO) that contains codes for: diseases, signs and symptoms, abnormal findings, complaints, social circumstances, and external causes of injury or diseases. Hospitals and insurance companies alike could save time and money by leveraging Watson to properly tag the most accurate ICD-10 codes.

This application is a Python web application based on the [Flask microframework](http://flask.pocoo.org/), and based on earlier work done by [Ryan Anderson](https://github.com/rustyoldrake/IBM_Watson_NLC_ICD10_Health_Codes). It uses the [Watson Python SDK](https://github.com/watson-developer-cloud/python-sdk) to create the classifier, list classifiers, and classify the input text. We also make use of the freely available [ICD-10 API](http://icd10api.com/) which, given an ICD-10 code, returns a name and description.

When the reader has completed this pattern, they will understand how to:

* Create a Natural Language Classifier (NLC) service and use it in a Python application.
* Train a NLC model using csv data.
* Deploy a web app with Flask to allow the NLC model to be queried.
* Quickly get a classification of a disease or health issue using the Natural Language Classifier trained model.

## Flow

1. CSV files are sent to the Natural Language Classifier service to train the model.
2. The user interacts with the web app UI running either locally or in the cloud.
3. The application sends the user's input to the Natural Language Classifier model to be classified.
4. The information containing the classification is returned to the web app.

## Prerequisites

Here we create the classifier with our ICD-10 dataset.

1. Clone this project: `git clone git@github.com:IBM/nlc-icd10-classifier.git` and `cd` into the new directory.

1. We'll be using `ICD-10-GT-AA.csv` dataset in the `data` folder
    > Note that this is a subset of the entire ICD-10 classification set, which allows faster training time

1. Go to the IBM Cloud dashboard and Create a Natural Language Classifier service instance by selecting **Catalog** and then typing in "Natural Language Classifier" in the search panel.  Select the tile and create the service using the `Standard` plan, make a note of the service name used in the catalog, we'll need this later.

    > Note: The NLC service only offers a `Standard` plan, which allows:
    ```
    1 Natural Language Classifier free per month.
    1000 API calls free per month
    4 Training Events free per month
    ```
    After that, there are charges for the use of the service when using a paid account.

1. When the instance is created you will see a screen where you can copy the service credentials. Copy the API key for later use.

    > NLC service instances created after 10/30/18 will have an API key, instances from before this date will provide userid / password credentials.

    ![](doc/source/images/NLC-service.png)

1. Export the username and password as environment variables and then load the data using the command below. If you have an API key, use `apikey` for the username and the API key for the password. This will take around 4.5 hours.

    ```bash
    export USERNAME=<username_from_credentials>
    export PASSWORD=<pasword_from_credentials>
    export FILE=data/ICD-10-GT-AA.csv

    curl -i --user "$USERNAME":"$PASSWORD" -F training_data=@$FILE -F training_metadata="{\"language\":\"en\",\"name\":\"ICD-10Classifier\"}" "https://gateway.watsonplatform.net/natural-language-classifier/api/v1/classifiers"
    ```

1. After running the command to create the classifier, note the `classifier_id` in the json that is returned:

    ```JSON
    {
      "classifier_id" : "ab2aa6x341-nlc-1176",
      "name" : "ICD-10Classifier",
      "language" : "en",
      "created" : "2018-04-18T14:09:28.403Z",
      "url" : "https://gateway.watsonplatform.net/natural-language-classifier/api/v1/classifiers/ab2aa6x341-nlc-1176",
      "status" : "Training",
      "status_description" : "The classifier instance is in its training phase, not yet ready to accept classify requests"
    }
    ```

    and export that as an environment variable:

    ```bash
    export CLASSIFIER_ID=<my_classifier_id>
    ```

    Now you can check the status for training your classifier:

    ```bash
    curl --user "$USERNAME":"$PASSWORD" "https://gateway.watsonplatform.net/natural-language-classifier/api/v1/classifiers/$CLASSIFIER_ID"
    ```

## Steps

This application can be run locally or hosted on IBM Cloud, follow the steps below depending on your deployment choice

### Run locally

1. Clone this project: `git clone git@github.com:IBM/nlc-icd10-classifier.git`

1. `cd` into this project's root directory

1. (Optionally) create a virtual environment: `virtualenv my-nlc-classifier`
    1. Activate the virtual environment: `. my-nlc-classifier/bin/activate`

1. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the app's dependencies

1. Copy the `env.example` file to `.env`

1. Update the `.env` file  with the NLC credentials for either username/password or API key

    ```bash
    # Replace the credentials here with your own using either USERNAME/PASSWORD or IAM_APIKEY
    # Comment out the unset environment variables
    # Rename this file to .env before running welcome.py.

    NATURAL_LANGUAGE_CLASSIFIER_USERNAME=<add_NLC_username>
    NATURAL_LANGUAGE_CLASSIFIER_PASSWORD=<add_NLC_password>

    NATURAL_LANGUAGE_CLASSIFIER_IAM_APIKEY=<add_NLC_iam_apikey>
    ```

1. Run `python welcome.py`

1. Access the running app in a browser at `http://localhost:5000`

### Run on IBM Cloud

1. Clone this project: `git clone git@github.com:IBM/nlc-icd10-classifier.git`

1. `cd` into this project's root directory

1. Update [`manifest.yml`](manifest.yml) with the NLC service name (`your_nlc_service_name`), a unique application name (`your_app_name`) and unique host value (`your_app_host`)


    ```yaml
    applications:
      - path: .
      memory: 256M
      instances: 1
      domain: mybluemix.net
      name: your_app_name
      host: your_app_host
      disk_quota: 1024M
      services:
      - your_nlc_service_name
      buildpack: python_buildpack
    ```

1. After logging in to the IBM Cloud CLI, if you have a Natural Language Classifier as a resource group service (it will have an API key for the credential), create a Cloud Foundry service alias. Otherwise, skip to the next step.

    ```bash
    ibmcloud target --cf
    ibmcloud resource service-alias-create your_nlc_service_name --instance-name your_nlc_service_name
    ```

1. Deploy the application as a Cloud Foundry runtime with `ibmcloud app push` from the root directory

1. Access the running app by going to: `https://<host-value>.mybluemix.net/`

    > If you've never run the `bluemix` command before there is some configuration required, refer to the official [IBM Cloud CLI](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/cli/reference/bluemix_cli/get_started.html) docs to get this set up.

# Sample Output

The user inputs information into the `Text to classify:` box and the Watson NLC classifier will return ICD10 classifications with confidence scores.
Here is the output for the input `Gastrointestinal hemorrhage`:
